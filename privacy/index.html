  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Your privacy is very important to Hecho. This Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to get to know our practices and contact us if you have any questions.</p>

  <h1>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h1>
  <p>Non-personal information is data that cannot be used to uniquely identify a specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. We may combine personal and non-personal information for certain purposes; this data will then be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined. Conversely, aggregated information, i.e. data that might have originated from personal information, but that has been processed in such a way as to not allow personal identification, is treated as non-personal information.</p>

  <p>Here are some examples of non-personal information that we collect â€“ either by ourselves or through the use of third-party services:</p>

  <p>When you create a reminder we record what type of reminder was created (e.g. Recurring, Timer) so that we can better optimize how we create those reminders.  We'll also send information regarding the language of your device so we can improve language support for Daphne.</p>

  <h1>Information usage</h1>
  <p>We use information we collect to operate and improve our apps and customer support. We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Daphne's functionality.
  We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.
  In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p>

  <p>By using Daphne, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>

  <h1>Contacting us</h1>
  <p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email scott@hecho.io</p>

  <h1>Changes to this policy</h1>
  <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the Privacy Policy modification date below. This policy was last modified on December 17, 2015.</p>
