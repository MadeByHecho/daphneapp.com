        <h2>What languages does Daphne support?</h2>
        <p>So this is a somewhat complicated problem that I'll try and break down into a few different parts.  Daphne is localized in English, Spanish, and French (that just means the words you seen in the app will appear in these languages). However, Daphne is only localized for Accessibility in English but with plans to at least match the app localization in the future.  Finally Daphne can parse many different languages by default but use of many of those languages could lead to undefined results.  Daphne natively supports English, and has greatly improved support in English and Spanish (they should be considered 'in beta') but Daphne is very keen on learning more and more languages.  Feel free to send us a support reuqest for any languages you'd like to see us support down the line.</p>
